I created a mongo database in the default location (/data/db) with 'use meteor'
I insert a fake document which created the collection:

db.jobs.insert({name:'test',client:'test client'})

to connect to this external mongo database I created a package.json file inside the api folder (the meteor project)
I added an npm script to run the following:

MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/meteor meteor

reset mongo database
meteor reset doesn't work on external databases so we have to use mongo's db.dropDatabase

use:

npm run api:reset
